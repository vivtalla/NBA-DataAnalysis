# NBA-DataAnalysis

This project is used for my first assignment in my EECS 731 course. The purpose of
the assignment is to get familiar with a python environment, along with using learning
how to effectively use pandas. In this assignment I will be exploring public NBA data sets,
and using fundamental data science techniques to both visualize and develop basic predictions
based off the data.
